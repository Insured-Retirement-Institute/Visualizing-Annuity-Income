## Business Case
Define your business case for the specification.

## User Storie1 - for Visualizing Income that has started
Day1 Use Case 1: A portfolio management and reporting tool can be used for near-accurate income planning where the annuity short-term income (12 months) has been activated for inforce policies.  This use case shows baseline income to provide the near-accurate snap-shot of income for the next rolling 12 months including income that has started (income rider activated) or the contract has been annuitized . 

User Story 1: As a financial advisor, I want to get a snapshot in time in my portfolio tool for near-accurate income planning that includes the inforce annuity to present a comprehensive look at activated income on the annuity over the next 12 months (rolling). 

-	Near-accurate income means that some nuances may not be included but nuances will be called out in the disclaimer.
-	Income started means, any living benefit that generates an income stream, payout or distribution, or annuitization (Systematic income related to a guarantee)
-	Data the FP needs to know must be present:
-	Must know the payment schedule: 	last payment, amount of last payment and frequency. That number will be replicated for the frequency to get a near-accurate view of the income as it is known at that time. 
- Definition if that payment amount is gross of taxes or net of taxes (either is fine but it needs to be disclosed)
-	Nice to have: Separate guaranteed income/secure income from non-guaranteed/other income so the annuity is seen as a differentiator
-	Nice to have: important dates related to the contract like renewal dates

Day1 Use Case 2:  A portfolio management and reporting tool can be used for directionally accurate income availability planning where the annuity short-term income (12 months) has not been activated for inforce policies.  The contract is in the accumulation phase and they want to show what income is possible on the contract. 

## User Storie2 - for Visualizing Income Availability
User Story 2: As a financial advisor, I want to use my portfolio tool for directionally accurate income planning to present a rough plan for the available income over the next 12 months (rolling). 
-	Income availability means income rider is not turned on yet.
-	Provide an estimated annual income if started today, in 5 years, or in 7 years. Here is the amount over the next 12 months (day 1). 
-	Future ask: show projections further out. -â€¢	Data:  the benefit base with step-ups and roll-ups and guarantees, age when they expect to start income to calculate rolling 12 month projections.
-	Income availability: available guarantees
